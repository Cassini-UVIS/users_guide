  abstract  = "The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) is part of
               the remote sensing payload of the Cassini orbiter spacecraft.
               UVIS has two spectrographic channels that provide images and
               spectra covering the ranges from 56 to 118 nm and 110 to 190 nm.
               A third optical path with a solar blind CsI photocathode is used
               for high signal-to-noise-ratio stellar occultations by rings and
               atmospheres. A separate Hydrogen Deuterium Absorption Cell
               measures the relative abundance of deuterium and hydrogen from
               their Lyman-$\alpha$ emission. The UVIS science objectives
               include investigation of the chemistry, aerosols, clouds, and
               energy balance of the Titan and Saturn atmospheres; neutrals in
               the Saturn magnetosphere; the deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H) ratio
               for Titan and Saturn; icy satellite surface properties; and the
               structure and evolution of Saturn's rings.",
