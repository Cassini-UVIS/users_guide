               the remote sensing payload of the Cassini orbiter spacecraft.
               UVIS has two spectrographic channels that provide images and
               spectra covering the ranges from 56 to 118 nm and 110 to 190 nm.
               A third optical path with a solar blind CsI photocathode is used
               for high signal-to-noise-ratio stellar occultations by rings and
               atmospheres. A separate Hydrogen Deuterium Absorption Cell
               measures the relative abundance of deuterium and hydrogen from
               their Lyman-$\alpha$ emission. The UVIS science objectives
               include investigation of the chemistry, aerosols, clouds, and
               energy balance of the Titan and Saturn atmospheres; neutrals in
               the Saturn magnetosphere; the deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H) ratio
               for Titan and Saturn; icy satellite surface properties; and the
               structure and evolution of Saturn's rings.",

  abstract = "We have analyzed the Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer
              (UVIS) observations of the Jupiter aurora with an auroral
              atmosphere two-stream electron transport code. The observations
              of Jupiter by UVIS took place during the Cassini Campaign. The
              Cassini Campaign included support spectral and imaging
              observations by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope
              Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). A major result for the UVIS
              observations was the identification of a large color variation
              between the far ultraviolet (FUV: 1100--1700 {\AA}) and extreme
              ultraviolet (EUV: 800--1100 {\AA}) spectral regions. This change
              probably occurs because of a large variation in the ratio of the
              soft electron flux (10--3000 eV) responsible for the EUV aurora
              to the hard electron flux (∼15--22 keV) responsible for the FUV
              aurora. On the basis of this result a new color ratio for
              integrated intensities for EUV and FUV was defined
              (4$\pi$I1550--1620 {\AA}/4$\pi$I1030--1150 {\AA}) which varied by
              approximately a factor of 6. The FUV color ratio
              (4$\pi$I1550--1620 {\AA}/4$\pi$I1230--1300 {\AA}) was more stable
              with a variation of less than 50\% for the observations studied.
              The medium resolution (0.9 {\AA} FWHM, G140M grating) FUV
              observations (1295--1345 {\AA} and 1495--1540 {\AA}) by STIS on
              13 January 2001, on the other hand, were analyzed by a spectral
              modeling technique using a recently developed high-spectral
              resolution model for the electron-excited H2 rotational lines.
              The STIS FUV data were analyzed with a model that considered the
              Lyman band spectrum (B $\Sigma$u+1$\rightarrow$X$\Sigma$g+1) as
              composed of an allowed direct excitation component (X
              $\Sigma$g+1$\rightarrow$B$\Sigma$u+1) and an optically forbidden
              component (X
              $\Sigma$g+1$\rightarrow$EF,GK,HH\textasciimacron{},…$\Sigma$g+1
              followed by the cascade transition
              $\Sigma$g+1$\rightarrow$B$\Sigma$u+1). The medium-resolution
              spectral regions for the Jupiter aurora were carefully chosen to
              emphasize the cascade component. The ratio of the two components
              is a direct measurement of the mean secondary electron energy of
              the aurora. The mean secondary electron energy of the aurora
              varies between 50 and 200 eV for the polar cap, limb and auroral
              oval observations. We examine a long time base of Galileo
              Ultraviolet Spectrometer color ratios from the standard mission
              (1996--1998) and compare them to Cassini UVIS, HST, and
              International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) observations.",
