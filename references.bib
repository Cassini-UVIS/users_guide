              (UVIS) observations of the Jupiter aurora with an auroral
              atmosphere two-stream electron transport code. The observations
              of Jupiter by UVIS took place during the Cassini Campaign. The
              Cassini Campaign included support spectral and imaging
              observations by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope
              Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). A major result for the UVIS
              observations was the identification of a large color variation
              between the far ultraviolet (FUV: 1100--1700 {\AA}) and extreme
              ultraviolet (EUV: 800--1100 {\AA}) spectral regions. This change
              probably occurs because of a large variation in the ratio of the
              soft electron flux (10--3000 eV) responsible for the EUV aurora
              to the hard electron flux (∼15--22 keV) responsible for the FUV
              aurora. On the basis of this result a new color ratio for
              integrated intensities for EUV and FUV was defined
              (4$\pi$I1550--1620 {\AA}/4$\pi$I1030--1150 {\AA}) which varied by
              approximately a factor of 6. The FUV color ratio
              (4$\pi$I1550--1620 {\AA}/4$\pi$I1230--1300 {\AA}) was more stable
              with a variation of less than 50\% for the observations studied.
              The medium resolution (0.9 {\AA} FWHM, G140M grating) FUV
              observations (1295--1345 {\AA} and 1495--1540 {\AA}) by STIS on
              13 January 2001, on the other hand, were analyzed by a spectral
              modeling technique using a recently developed high-spectral
              resolution model for the electron-excited H2 rotational lines.
              The STIS FUV data were analyzed with a model that considered the
              Lyman band spectrum (B $\Sigma$u+1$\rightarrow$X$\Sigma$g+1) as
              composed of an allowed direct excitation component (X
              $\Sigma$g+1$\rightarrow$B$\Sigma$u+1) and an optically forbidden
              component (X
              $\Sigma$g+1$\rightarrow$EF,GK,HH\textasciimacron{},…$\Sigma$g+1
              followed by the cascade transition
              $\Sigma$g+1$\rightarrow$B$\Sigma$u+1). The medium-resolution
              spectral regions for the Jupiter aurora were carefully chosen to
              emphasize the cascade component. The ratio of the two components
              is a direct measurement of the mean secondary electron energy of
              the aurora. The mean secondary electron energy of the aurora
              varies between 50 and 200 eV for the polar cap, limb and auroral
              oval observations. We examine a long time base of Galileo
              Ultraviolet Spectrometer color ratios from the standard mission
              (1996--1998) and compare them to Cassini UVIS, HST, and
              International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) observations.",

              Temporal, radial and azimuthal variations",
  author   = "Steffl, Andrew Joseph",
  editor   = "Bagenal, Fran",
  abstract = "During the Cassini spacecraft's flyby of Jupiter (1 October 2000
              to 31 March 2001), the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS)
              produced an extensive dataset consisting of several thousand
              spectrally-dispersed images of the lo plasma torus. The temporal,
              radial, and azimuthal variability of the to plasma torus during
              this period are examined. The total EUV power radiated from the
              torus is found to be ∼1.7 $\times$ 1012 W with variations of
              25\%. Several events were observed during which the torus
              brightened by 20\% over a few hours. Significant changes in the
              composition of the torus plasma were observed between 1 October
              2000 and 11 November 2000. The composition and electron
              temperature of the torus plasma as a function of radial distance
              were derived from a scale of the midnight sector of the torus.
              The radial profile during the Cassini epoch shows significant
              differences from the Voyager era. The Io torus is found to
              exhibit significant azimuthal variations in ion composition. This
              compositional variation is observed to have a period of 10.07
              hours 1.5\% longer than the System III rotation period of
              Jupiter. While exhibiting many similar characteristics, the
              periodicity in the UVIS data is 1.3\% shorter than the ``System
              IV'' period. The amplitude of the azimuthal variation of S II and
              S IV varies between 5--25\% during the observing period, while
              the amplitude of the variation of S III and O II remains in the
              range of 2--5\%. The amplitude of the azimuthal compositional
              asymmetry appears to be modulated by its location in System III
              longitude. The observed temporal variability is reproduced by
              models of the torus chemistry that include a factor of 3 increase
              in the rate of oxygen and sulfur atoms supplied to the extended
              neutral clouds that are the source of the torus plasma coupled
              with a ∼35\% increase in the amount of riot electrons in the Io
              torus. The observed azimuthal variability of the Io torus is well
              matched by models incorporating a primary source of hot electrons
              that slips 12.2°/day relative to the System III coordinate system
              and a secondary source of hot electrons that remains fixed in
              System III.",
