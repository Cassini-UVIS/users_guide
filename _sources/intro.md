## About this book

As part of a NASA PDART project to create a new UVIS data format, PI Michael Aye converted the existing UVIS manual in revised version of July 6, 2018 to this form of a Jupyter Book that can be published either as a static HTML website or as a PDF.

During this conversion minor changes like updated or corrected hyperlinks to resources were performed, plus layout changes that seemed advantageous in the online form.

An up-to-date chapter on how to work with the new PDS format using Python will be added at the end of the project (2023).

## Introduction

```
Larry Esposito
```

The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) is a multi-faceted experiment on the
Cassini orbiter. The instrument is described by {cite:t}`Esposito2004-kr`.
Instrument updates, news and publications may be found on the public web-site, https://lasp.colorado.edu/cassini/.

This guide provides information and examples for using UVIS data that is available in the
Planetary Data System, with individual chapters written by members of the UVIS Science Team.
Each of the chapters describes a different data type.
Examples are shown. 
Because a number of different approaches have been successfully used by UVIS Team members, a number of alternate instructions are given in the different chapters. 
For example, the simplest approach to calibration is given in {ref}`sec:calib`, and alternate approaches are given in Chapters 4, 9 and 10. 
Questions should be addressed to a member of the science team or to David Judd (303-492-8582,
david.judd@lasp.colorado.edu). 
This guide was supported by a grant from NASA Headquarters.

We look forward to the larger scientific communityâ€™s productive use of the UVIS data.
