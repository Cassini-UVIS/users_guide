During the Cassini spacecraft’s tour of the solar system, the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) has observed Venus, Earth, the Jovian and Saturn systems.
The UVIS science team has delivered data to the Planetary Data System for storage in an historical archive. 
PDS clients are able to search, retrieve and analyze this data. 
This chapter supports those users by providing a description of UVIS data and its organization within the PDS.

In PDS, an “observation” is the fundamental organizational unit of UVIS data. 
It is a set of integers representing detector counts obtained while the instrument had a particular configuration and was obtained for a particular purpose. 
A document entitled `UVISREF.CAT` is located in all UVIS data volumes at the PDS and describes the instrument in detail. 

In summary, it describes the four subsystems of the UVIS instrument: 
* the Far Ultraviolet channel (FUV), 
* the Extreme Ultraviolet channel (EUV), 
* the High Speed Photometer (HSP) and 
* the Hydrogen/Deuterium Absorption Cell (HDAC) 
and how they acquire data.

The four subsystems produce two PDS data types: 1) cubes; and 2) time series. 
The EUV and FUV channels use detectors with a 1024x64 array of pixels, which integrate over time to generate a three dimensional matrix. 
The axes of this matrix, using PDS terminology, are line, band, and sample. 
The line dimension is the detector’s 64 pixel spatial dimension, the band is the 1024 pixel spectral dimension, and the sample dimension corresponds to time where each integration of the detector is arrayed in this dimension. 
A three dimensional matrix with these axes is referred to as a PDS cube. 
The HSP and HDAC are photometers which produce a time ordered sequence of photon counts, corresponding to a PDS time series.

Regardless of its PDS data structure, there are four UVIS data products: 

1. spatial-spectral image cubes,
2. images, 
3. spectra, 
4. brightness time series. 

In each sample, a cube contains both spatial and spectral information about a target, the image contains only spatial information, and a spectrum contains only spectral information. 
The time series is a sequence of samples (photon counts). 
An image is generated from a cube by summing the detector counts across the entire wavelength dimension; a spectrum is generated from a cube by summing across the entire spatial dimension. 
The brightness time series is produced by the HSP or HDAC channels. 
These data products are illustrated in the following figures:

A brightness series from the HSP or HDAC is a time series: {ct0, ct1, ...}.
The following surface plot Figure 2.2 is the first sample of a UVIS EUV spatial-spectral
image cube from an observation of Jupiter:

The elevated line at y=~20 is Jupiter. 
The elevated regions at Y=~15 and Y=~25 are emissions from the Io torus. 
There are 32 lines and 512 bands of data because the binning in this observation is 2 spatially and 2 spectrally.

## Windows

The EUV and FUV channels can be configured to take data from sub-regions of the
1024x64 detector called windows. 
For example, if a target is expected to be visible in the central region of the detector then a window centered around the middle of the detector with an upper left corner at (0, 24) and a lower right corner at (1023, 39) with dimensions 1024x16 would capture the target and minimize irrelevant data. 
If a reduced level of resolution is possible, then the detector could be binned to further reduce the data size. Binning is the summation of adjacent pixels, for example, binning by 2 causes adjacent pairs of pixels to be added together. 
For example this [(0,24), (1023,39)] window could be binned by two in the band (spectral)
dimension resulting in a 512x16 array of pixels. 
We take as an example two additional windows defined by window1 = ([0,10],[1023, 14], SpaBin=5, SpecBin=1) and
window3 = ([0, 5 0],[1023, 5 4], SpaBin=5, SpecBin=1). 
When windowing or binning is defined on the detector, counts are arranged within the matrix in sub-matrices corresponding to the windows of the detector. 

Figure 2.3 illustrates this windowing and binning:

```
Figure 2.3: an example of windows in the UVIS detector
```
The image, spectrum and cube data products are represented in the PDS as cubes. Images
are 1 x 64 x n cubes, spectra are 1024 x 1 x n cubes and spatial-spectral image cubes are 1024 x
64 x n cubes. The following Figure 2.4 provides an example UVIS cube corresponding to the
windowed and binned detector configuration in Figure 2.3:

```
Figure 2. 4 : an example of PDS data corresponding to the example offered in diagram 2. 3.
```
Matrix elements outside the windows contain null values (-1). Data counts are ordered in
line-major ordering. This structural analogy between detector windows and cubes holds for
spectra and images as well. The solar-stellar brightness series are represented as PDS Time
Series objects that are, simply, a series of detector counts, each with an associated timestamp.
To this point we have seen several configurable aspects of the UVIS instrument, namely,
integration time and the detector windowing and binning. Windows are defined by the upper left
and lower right corners of the window and an associated spatial bin and spectral bin. These
values are specified in the PDS using name/value pairs. In PDS format, the previous example
had INTEGRATION_DURATION = 1 <SECOND>, and three windows defined using their
upper left corner, lower right corner and binning:

```
UL_CORNER_SPECTRAL = (0,0,0)
UL_CORNER_SPATIAL = (10, 24, 50)
LR_SPECTRAL = (1023, 1023, 1023)
LR_SPATIAL = (14, 39, 54)
SPATIAL_BIN = (5, 1, 5)
SPECTRAL_BIN = (1, 2, 1)
```

The structure of a UVIS Cube is specified using the AXIS_NAME, CORE_ITEMS,
CORE_ITEM_BYTES and CORE_ITEM_TYPE values. A 1024x64x10 UVIS Cube object is
specified by:

```
AXIS_NAME = (BAND, LINE, SAMPLE)
CORE_ITEMS = (1024, 64, 10)
CORE_ITEM_BYTES = 2
CORE_ITEM_TYPE = MSB_UNSIGNED_INTEGER
```

A 1024x1x10 series of spectra is specified by:

```
AXIS_NAME = (BAND, LINE, SAMPLE)
CORE_ITEMS = (1024, 1, 10)
CORE_ITEM_BYTES = 2
CORE_ITEM_TYPE = MSB_UNSIGNED_INTEGER
```

Time series are specified using ROWS, COLUMNS, ROW_BYTES, and DATA_TYPE.
The following defines a 14912 element time series of 2 byte integers:

```
ROWS = 14912
COLUMNS = 1
SAMPLING_PARAMETER_NAME = TIME
SAMPLING_PARAMETER_UNIT = MILLISECOND
SAMPLING_PARAMETER_INTERVAL= 125
...
OBJECT = COLUMN
NAME = PHOTOMETER_COUNTS
DATA_TYPE = MSB_UNSIGNED_INTEGER
BYTES = 2
```

All UVIS data objects are composed of 2 byte unsigned integers, though all values are
significantly less than 2^16.
The FUV and EUV channel data are converted into geophysical units by multiplying the
matrix of raw data by a corresponding matrix of calibration coefficients. This calibration is
continually updated by the UVIS Team, so the user may use the latest calibration data, or if
preferred, use the calibration data matrix to convert model results to expected UVIS counts for
comparison. This calibration matrix is a 2-dimensional array with the same BAND and LINE
dimensions as its corresponding data object. The calibration matrix contains floating point
values. The product of the data cube and the calibration cube is data whose geophysical units are
kilorayleighs per angstrom. The mapping between detector columns and wavelengths is specified
in the PDS BAND_BIN_CENTER value where each value in the list is a wavelength associated
with the corresponding detector column. The process used to generate calibration coefficients is
described in Chapter 3 of this user’s guide. Because the calibration is continually updated, the
calibration matrix may change with time. By providing the latest calibration coefficients, we
allow the user to calibrate the raw data to geophysical units (alternately, users may use their own
model of the target and the instrument response to compare to the raw data). See Chapter 9 for


this approach. HSP and HDAC data in raw form have units of counts (per integration period) and
are proportional to photon flux. There is no additional calibration defined for these data.
PDS data objects have two components, a data component and a label component. The
label contains a set of name/value pairs, including those listed above. The data file contains data
values formatted into a PDS object. These components are stored as files whose names contain
the extensions DAT and LBL respectively. UVIS data object file names have the form
<channel><start_time>.LBL or <channel><start_time>.DAT. The LBL files contain instrument
configuration, spacecraft geometry, and taxonomic information describing UVIS data within the
PDS. Using the information within a LBL, a reader can understand the organization of data
within the DAT file and extract that data into an analysis tool. For example, in the IDL
programming language, the read_binary function can read a data Cube such as the one defined
above:
r = read_binary(‘FUV2001_001_01_02.DAT’, data_type = 2,
data_dims=[1024, 64, 10])

which returns a 1024x64x10 array of 2 byte integers. Similarly, read_binary can be used to read
an HSP or HDAC data file since each is organized as a one dimensional array. Other
configuration fields within a UVIS Cube label further describe the state of the instrument. For
example:
SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT = "1/1633050431.160"
SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_STOP_COUNT = "UNK"
START_TIME = 2009-274T00:24:32.
STOP_TIME = 2009-274T00:36:32.
TARGET_NAME = "SOLAR WIND"
OBSERVATION_ID = 112818
INTEGRATION_DURATION = 12.500 <SECOND>
COMPRESSION_TYPE = "SQRT_9"
HI_VOLTAGE_POWER_SUPPLY_STATE = ON
OCCULTATION_PORT_STATE = OPEN
SLIT_STATE = OCCULTATION
TEST_PULSE_STATE = OFF
ODC_ID = 103
DESCRIPTION = ".. ."

where the clock start is the Cassini clock time at the end of the first sample, the start time is a
text string corresponding to the spacecraft clock start time, the stop time is a derived value
produced by multiplying the INTEGRATION_DURATION by the number of samples, the target
name is a value defined during operations planning, the OBSERVATION_ID is a unique
numerical value associated with the observation, the INTEGRATION_DURATION is the time
period used to generate each sample, the COMPRESSION_TYPE is the algorithm used by the
UVIS flight software to encode data on-board and during transmission to earth, the
HI_VOLTAGE_POWER_SUPPLY_STATE is the voltage level applied to the detector, the
OCCULTATION_PORT_STATE is a flag indicating whether the occultation port is open or
closed (i.e. whether the light source is being observed through the port), the SLIT_STATE
describes the width of the spectrometer entrance, the TEST_PULSE_STATE indicates whether
the data is internally-generated, and the ODC_ID is a numeric value identifying the configuration
commands generated by the operations team for this observation. There are two DESCRIPTION


fields in a label. The first contains a reference to additional material for understanding the
instrument state. The second contains a one line description of the purpose of the observation
which has the form “The purpose of this observation is to...”. The fields relevant to
understanding data are spacecraft clock, target, integration, slit state and description. The other
fields are less important and are included in the label because they are part of UVIS telemetry:
high voltage state is always ON, test pulse is always OFF, ODC_ID is used exclusively in
operations management, the compression algorithm, although lossy, has no significant effect on
data quality, and observation ID is useful only as a reference point.
The HDAC replaces INTEGRATION_DURATION with DWELL_TIME and the
H_LEVEL and D_LEVEL parameters. The time series generated by the HDAC channel may
have additional complexity. If all the filament voltage levels are 0 then the HDAC is in
photometer mode and its output is a time series of detector counts. If there is a non-zero filament
voltage level the detector is in modulation mode and the time series can be mapped into a table
of 32 columns, each column corresponding to an HDAC filament voltage level in the order:
d1...d16, h1...h16 where d1..d16 correspond to the 16 voltage levels of the d cell and h1..h16 the
same for the h cell. The time series can be converted to the table by mapping contiguous
subsequences into the successive columns of the table. The length of the subsequence is equal to
the dwell time parameter of the instrument configuration. A data product consists of a set of data
taken during a single instrument configuration.
Label files contain spacecraft pointing geometry computed for the time at the end of the
first integration at the center of the field of view of the instrument. The keywords specifying this
geometry are:
RIGHT_ASCENSION, DECLINATION, SUB_SOLAR_LATITUDE,
SUB_SOLAR_LONGITUDE, SUB_SPACECRAFT_LATITUDE,
SUB_SPACECRAFT_LONGITUDE, PHASE_ANGLE, EMISSION_ANGLE,
INCIDENCE_ANGLE, CENTRAL_BODY_DISTANCE, PLANET_POSITION_VECTOR,
SC_PLANET_VELOCITY_VECTOR, SC_SUN_POSITION_VECTOR,
SC_SUN_VELOCITY_VECTOR, SC_TARGET_POSITION_VECTOR,
SC_TARGET_VELOCITY_VECTOR, PLANET_CENTER_POSITION_VECTOR,
PLANET_CENTER_VELOCITY_VECTOR

Their values are in units of degrees for angles, kilometers for distances, and kilometers/second
for velocities and are given in the J2000 reference frame. Geometry values are generated using
the NAIF SPICE toolkit. When a geometry value cannot be computed due to a dispersed target
(such as observation of the interplanetary medium), or insufficient ephemeris data (such as when
the target is off-center) a value of UNK is recorded as the parameter value. Since the number of
interplanetary hydrogen survey observations with a target of SOLAR_WIND is relatively high,
the number of UNK values is also high.
Data objects are stored in files within a data volume. A data volume is a directory tree
whose content and structure is defined by PDS. The UVIS data volume has a name of the form
COUVIS_nnnn where CO is an acronym for Cassini Orbiter, UVIS is the instrument name, and
nnnn is a number in a sequence of indices. During the Cassini mission, UVIS produced data
volumes from COUVIS_0001 through COUVIS_0060. The top level directory contains several
directories and files:

- DATA contains data objects
- CALIB contains calibration objects


- DOCUMENT contains documentation
- CATALOG contains catalogs of data products on the volume
- SOFTWARE contains software (used for documentation only)
- AAREADME.TXT describes the data volume
- ERRATA.TXT describes know errors.
The UVIS data object files are organized by date under the DATA directory. The CALIB
directory contains files that correspond, by name, to FUV and EUV data object files. These
calibration files contain Cube data objects, used to convert raw counts into geophysical values.
The calibration LBL files contain a description of the calibration process. The SOFTWARE
directory contains algorithms used to generate these coefficients and are included for reference.
The INDEX directory contains a relational database table whose columns are the fields of the
LBL files and which contain the label values as records in the table. The purpose of the
INDEX.TAB file is to provide a database search capability.
Underneath the DATA directory is a sequence of directories of the form
D<yyyy>_<ddd> where yyyy is a year and ddd is a day of year. The contents of these
directories are the observations that began on the specified day, for example,
COUVIS_0002/DATA/D2001_001/FUV2001_001_01_12.LBL. Underneath the CALIB
directory is a subdirectory of the form VERSION_n and under that is the same directory tree as
is under DATA, for example:
COUVIS_0002/CALIB/VERSION_2/D2001_001/FUV2001_001_01_12_CAL_2.LBL.
Note that as a rule the calibration file and its corresponding data object file have corresponding
names. Examples of data and calibration labels are given in the appendices. A description of the
calibration version is located in the SOFTWARE/CALIB directory of each PDS data volume.
Underneath the INDEX directory are two files, INDEX.LBL and INDEX.TAB. The
INDEX.LBL file contains a schema definition for a relational database table. The TAB file
contains a set of records corresponding to observations, one record per observation. One column
contains the data file name and the rest correspond to the keywords in the observation label, e.g.
START_TIME, TARGET_NAME, INTEGRATION_TIME, etc. The index table is used to
search for observations matching some user-specified criteria.
Underneath the DOCUMENT directory is the UVIS.TXT file that is a more substantial
version of this chapter. The CATALOG directory contains the files UVISINST.CAT and
UVISREF.CAT that describe the instrument in detail. Also included there are a description of
the mission, the spacecraft and the four UVIS data products. The SOFTWARE directory
contains algorithms encoded in the IDL programming language that are used to generate
calibration coefficients and geometry. They are included primarily for reference. An IDL data
reader, UVIS_PDS_READ_DATA and associated documentation are also provided.
UVIS data are available from the Atmospheres and Rings nodes of the PDS. From PDS,
users obtain observations formatted as PDS data objects. By reading the object’s label a user can
ascertain the structure of the data and load it into an analysis tool. The label contains all UVIS
state information necessary to interpret the data. The steps detailed in this document will make it
possible for UVIS data to be a valuable scientific resource into the foreseeable future.
